# Tough Cookie

### My first mock-client project
This repository contains my completed assignment for a mock-client project, designed to create a one-page website for a fictional client, Kantarella LÃ¶wenskog, as part of my coursework. The site was designed to follow a given brief and specifications, with additional design decisions made based on my own interpretation due to the absence of clear guidelines on some details.

This project showcases my ability to work within a given brief, make informed design decisions, and implement a one-page layout without JavaScript.

## Key Features

ðŸŽ¯ **One-Page layout:** The website is a "onepager," meaning users scroll vertically through content rather than navigating across multiple pages. <br>
ðŸŽ¯ **Navigation links:** The menu links are non-functional placeholders; they do not lead to separate sections or close when clicked. <br>
ðŸŽ¯ **Cookie text:** The cookie notification on the page is static and non-dismissable. <br>
ðŸŽ¯ **JavaScript-free:** No JavaScript was required for this project, so all interactions are CSS-based. <br>
ðŸŽ¯ **Responsive Layout:** The brief was incomplete regarding the mobile layout, so I inferred the design based on provided assets to ensure a mobile-friendly experience. <br>
